# Using GitHub.com for Collaboration and Learning

## Brian Zelip, University of Maryland, Baltimore

## Room 3022

GitHub.com is a project management tool that is central to the software
engineering world. It's equally powerful for other types of information-based
projects as well, with wide spread use throughout the social and life sciences,
digital humanities, journalism, libraries, and more. GitHub's best features
include: file versioning, easy sharing and authoring of project files, rich
discussion space for project tasks and ideas, web publishing, and access to the
public work of thousands of others to learn from and use. In this session
participants will take a guided tour of GitHub to learn about its core
functionalities, identify best practices for using GitHub, and explore open
educational resources hosted on GitHub.

Brian Zelip is the Emerging Technologies Librarian at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore. He runs the Health Sciences and Human Services Library's
Innovation Space, and gives workshops and talks about open source tools, front
end web development, and 3D printing.â€‹
