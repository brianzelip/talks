About me

Intro
So, a couple weeks ago I started working on this app for this talk, and I just shipped the minimum viable product this past weekend.

Node
  - imports / exports

Express
  - middleware
    - flashes
    - upload
    - resize
  - routing
  - singleton
  - show docs

Pug
  - js and logic
  - extends and mixins
  - compare it to liquid in gh pages
  - the edit-member method used to populate form fields with existing data
  - show docs

MongoDB
  - install it, run it via cli
  - Compass app (like phpMyAdmin)
  - Mongoose
  - show docs

Controller

View

Model



What's next / what didn't I get to in this app:
  - user login and sessions, edit profile button becomes available w/ user credentials
  - make more robust slugs on create/edit member
  - testing - i think i need browser not unit testing; nightwatch.js?
  - deploying it to the web (see mlab, glitch, and now)
